# Next.js Project

This project is developed using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). It provides a robust framework for building server-rendered React applications.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, you need to have Node.js installed on your system. You can download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Running the Development Server

To get started with the development server, follow these steps:

1. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # Or using Yarn
    yarn install
    # Or using pnpm
    pnpm install
    # Or using bun
    bun install
    ```

2. **Start the development server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    # or
    pnpm dev
    # or
    bun dev
    ```

3. **Open your browser**:
    Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view your application in action. The development server will automatically reload if you make changes to any of the source files.

### Modifying the Project

To start editing your project, open `pages/index.js` or any other page file under the `pages` directory. Changes in the code will be reflected instantly in the browser, thanks to the Hot Module Replacement (HMR) feature.

### Font Optimization

This project utilizes [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize loading fonts. We are using the Inter font from Google Fonts for enhanced text clarity and aesthetics.
